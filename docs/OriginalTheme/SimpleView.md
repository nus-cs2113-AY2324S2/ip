6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. Refer to the [Features](#features) section for available commands.
7. Note that the data is saved in the hard disk **automatically** after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.
8. Please take note that **deleting** the `tasks.dat` file will result in the **loss of all data**.

    If there is no `tasks.dat` file in the same directory as the `adam.jar` file, an empty `tasks.dat` file will be created to store the data.
