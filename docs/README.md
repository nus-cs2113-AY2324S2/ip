### Save Data
After each change to the current task list, the program automatically writes the updated tasks onto a file.
The default location of the saved textfile is a relative file path from 'tony.jar' 
and is located in a subfolder `./data/tonytask.txt`.

## FAQ
**Q:** Will my tasks in the list be wiped when I end the program?
**A:** No, the program creates a file and saved all the data into that file, and the next time the program is run,
the data is loaded back from the file.
