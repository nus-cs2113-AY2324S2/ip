# RecrBad project template

This is a project template for a greenfield RecrBad project. It's named after the RecrBad mascot _RecrBad_. 
Given below are instructions on how to use it.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 11, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project`
   to close the existing project first)
2. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
    1. Click `Open`.
    2. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
    3. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
3. Configure the project to use **JDK 11** (not other versions) as explained in
   [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default`
   option.
4. After that, locate the `src/main/java/RecrBad.java` file, right-click it, and
   choose `Run RecrBad.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try
   restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you should see something like the
   below as the output:

```
   Hello! I'm
 ____   ___    ___   ____    ___
