## Getting Started

To start using Lovie, ensure Java 11 is installed on your machine. Lovie specifically uses Java 11. 
Download Lovie from [here](https://github.com/nidhi-nayak/ip/releases/tag/A-Release) and run it using the Java command:

```
java -jar ip.jar
```

Upon launching, Lovie will very sweetly greet you and help you if you need a list of possible commands.

## Features

### Listing All Possible Commands

Lovie will happily list all possible commands you can ask her. Simply use the `command` input to get a list of 
everything you can do. 
```
command
```


### Adding Tasks

Lovie supports three types of tasks: Todos, Deadlines, and Events. Each task type is represented by a class
(`Todo`, `Deadline`, `Event`) that extends the abstract `Task` class, demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism.

- **Todos**: Tasks without a date/time.
  ```
  todo <EVENT DESCRIPTION>
  ```
- **Deadlines**: Tasks with a due date.
  ```
  deadline <EVENT DESCRIPTION> /by <DEADLINE>
  ```
- **Events**: Tasks with a start and end time.
  ```
  event <EVENT DESCRIPTION> /from <START TIME> /to <END TIME>
  ```

### Listing All Tasks

To see all tasks, use the `list` command. This feature leverages the `TaskList` class,
which encapsulates a list of `Task` objects.

```
list
```

### Marking Tasks as Done

Mark a task as done with the `mark` command. This action modifies the task's state, and (until changed or deleted) will 
remain in your list as done.

```
mark <TASK NUMBER>
```

### Unmarking Tasks

If a task was mistakenly marked as done, you can unmark it. 

```
unmark <TASK NUMBER>
```

### Deleting Tasks

Remove a task from your task list with the `delete` command. 

```
delete <TASK NUMBER>
```

### Finding Tasks

Search for tasks containing a specific keyword. This uses the `find` method in `TaskList`, 
which filters tasks based on those that contain the keyword.

```
find <KEYWORD>
```

## Exiting the Application

To leave Lovie, type `bye`.  

```
bye
```

Lovie will automatically save your tasks for the next session. So when reloading back, don't
hesitate to ask Lovie to `list` your previously saved tasks as a reminder!
