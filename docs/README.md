### Other useful tips:

 1. Find keyword usage

     When using `find [keyword]` you will get the real index of the tasks shown on the side. By knowing the real index you can use that in `mark, unmark or delete commands`. This make sures that you don't actually change the status or delete the wrong tasks.

      **Example:**
> 1[E][ ] Build Core Muscles (from: Jan 01 2025 12:01 to: Jun 21 2025 11:59).**(Original Index: 2)**


 2. Missing tasks.txt file or data folder
    
     If you don't have data folder or tasks.txt, the program will warn you and it will create a new file at that location if you continue to add tasks.
	 
	 **Example:**
   
          -----------------------------------------
               Unable to load File. Error loading tasks from file: .\data\tasks.txt (The system cannot find the file specified)
               Please Check your File path.
               Continuing will create a new file in the destination path
