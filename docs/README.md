## Saving the data
All task data input by the user is automatically saved by the app following any changes to <br>
the data in memory in the file `./data/tasklist.txt`. Ensure that the file is not corrupted. If the program exits on start up with the <br>
following line being displayed:
```dtd
error regarding file IO
```
delete the data file and restart the application. This will remove all data stored in the data file <br>
and allow for a clean start. Please also ensure that the user you are using has permission to the <br>
directory that the `fido.jar` file is in.

If the file is corrupted, the current data file will be discarded and a new file will be created

## Editing the data
It is highly not recommended to edit the data file as wrongly editing the file will lead to file corruption </br>
which will result in the user having to delete the file, losing all the data
