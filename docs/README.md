## FAQ

#### Q  -  How do I transfer my data to another computer?
- Download the `zuke.jar` file in the new computer and copy the `data` folder on your old machine 
to the same folder of the application in the new device. If there is an existing `data` folder, replace it with the copied `data` folder.
