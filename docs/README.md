## Starting BossMan
To start `BossMan` Using the `jar` file, go to the containing folder for BossMan. Then, on your terminal of choice, run:
```

```

## Features
BossMan comes with features for you to manage your daily tasks using CLI.

### Task Creation
Manage your work by creating tasks

BossMan provides three types of tasks for creation:
- `todo`, for general daily tasks
- `deadline`, for tasks that have deadlines
- `event`, for appointments and meetings

### Task Management
BossMan can help you `mark`, `unmark`, `list`, `delete` and `find` your tasks.
- mark allows you to tick off your todos, deadline and events so you can keep track of what tasks are done.
- unmark allows you to untick your tasks if you made an error or if the task is still not done.
- list can list all your tasks to get an overview of what you've done so far.
- delete can delete task specified in the user input
- find can filter the tasks you are looking for by using a keyword.

### Persistent State
BossMan automatically saves all your task data to a text file. When you start BossMan up again, it will load up your tasks from previous sessions automatically.
