# FredBot User Guide

FredBot is a desktop app for managing tasks, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Features 

### Managing tasks

There are three different types of tasks: Todos, Deadlines and Events.

Users can add, find and delete tasks from their task list.

### Tracking tasks

Tasks can be marked as done for easier tracking.

### Saving the task list

The task list is automatically saved on your computer, which is then loaded up the next time FredBot is opened.

## Usage
