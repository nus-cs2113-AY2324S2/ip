## Launching Davvy

To start the chatbot, go to the src folder containing the JAR file. Then, on a terminal of your choice, run:

```
-$ java -jar ip.jar
```
*This program is best executed with the Java-11 Runtime Environment*

## Features
*Davvy* comes jam-packed with features that allow you to use CLI to manage your upcoming tasks 

### Task Creation
Manage your upcoming tasks by adding and creating tasks:
1. `todo` for your everyday general tasks
2. `deadline` for tasks with a date goal in mind
3. `event` for time critical tasks and appointments

### Task Management
Track, edit and mark all of your tasks with ease!
- *Davvy* allows you to `mark` and `unmark` tasks, so you can focus on what is not done!
- *Davvy* allows you to `list` out all the tasks you have added so far.
- Made a wrong entry? Just `delete` and be on your way!

### Persistent State
*Davvy* helps you track even when the PC is shut! Data is saved to the local drive with every added task, and loaded
automatically on startup!
