# Kowalski Bot 
If you've watched **[Penguins of Madagascar](https://youtu.be/Z-5SrndEVrI?si=_ivcZTA_PTUoJhI8)**, you'll know **_[Kowalski](https://youtu.be/f3CVuo_HFLM?si=v1hv_y0UU4YP8HYb)_**.

He is often referred to as Skipper's Lieutenant, the second-in-command.

If you're someone who needs a Kowalski by your side at all times, this bot is for you!


## Overview 

Kowalski is a bot for you to keep track of your everyday tasks.
Be it keeping track of your homework assignments, 
your daily chores, Kowalski's got your back!

Kowalski has got 3 types of tasks - ToDo task, Deadline task, and Event task.

### Task types
- ToDo: Task with ```Name```
- Deadline: Task with ```Name``` and ```Deadline``` 
- Event: Task with ```Name```, ```From``` and ```To```


### Kowalski.txt

Kowalski is able to save the tasks which you add by storing them in a text file called **Kowalski.txt**.

If you are using this bot for the **_first time_**, this bot will 
automatically create a directory called **data** which will then store your **Kowalski.txt** inside of it.

E.g. ```C:\Users\Skipper\Desktop\Kowalski_Bot\data\Kowalski.txt``` 
assuming you are storing the jar file in ```C:\Users\Skipper\Desktop\Kowalski_Bot```
