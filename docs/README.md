## Saving the data file
Anonbot data are saved to the hard disk automatically when a new entry, modification or deletion is made 
to the task list. There is no need for you to save manually. 

By default, they are saved under `./data/tasklist.txt`.

## Editing the data file
Data files are saved in `./data/tasklist.txt`. Advanced users can modify the text file directly.

-->

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, 
anonbot will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. 
Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.

Furthermore, certain edits can cause anonbot to behave in unexpected ways. 
(e.g. Modifying the task number may end up with duplicate or unordered task numbers, which are not checked).

Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

# FAQ
**Q:** Can I transfer my data to another computer? If so, how?

**A:** You can. You just need to make sure that the `data` folder is at the same level with the `anonbot.jar` file.
The `tasklist.txt` file should be inside the `data` folder.
