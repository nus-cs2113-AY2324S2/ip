## Features 

### add task

In our task manager, you can add three types of tasks to organize your schedule effectively: deadline, event, and todo. Each task type is designed to help you manage your time and responsibilities efficiently.

#### Deadline
Deadlines are tasks that need to be completed by a specific time and date. They are perfect for assignments, projects, and other time-sensitive responsibilities.

#### Event
Events are scheduled activities that occur at a specific time and place. Use this type for meetings, appointments, and other important occasions.

#### Todo
Todos are tasks without a specific deadline or event time. They are suitable for day-to-day activities and reminders that need to be completed but are not time-bound.

### List Tasks
View all your tasks in a neatly organized list, including deadlines, events, and todos, with their completion status.

### Mark and Unmark Tasks
Easily update the completion status of your tasks, marking them as done or reverting them to incomplete.

### Delete Tasks
