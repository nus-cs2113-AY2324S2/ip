# GermaBot User Guide

GermaBot is a task list bot. You can add, delete, find and list the stored tasks. GermaBot recognizes 3 different type 
of tasks: Todo tasks, deadline tasks and event tasks. 
GermaBot is also capable of saving files to your local hard disk, to the `/src/data/GermaBotData.txt` file.

## Features 

> ## Notes about the command format.
> - Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
> - Extra parameters that do not take in any parameters (such as `list` and `bye`) will be ignored. 
> e.g. if the input is `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.
