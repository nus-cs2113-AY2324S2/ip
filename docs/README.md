# Lotes User Guide

Lotes is a command line interface (CLI) application where you can use to **manage your tasks** with just commands through the interface.

## Requirements
1. Ensure that you have `Java 11` installed in your Windows computer.
2. Download the latest `lotes.jar` from [here](https://github.com/e0958902/ip/releases).
3. Copy `lotes.jar` to a directory you want Lotes to run.
4. `Press and hold down shift` then `right-click` the directory and click `Open in Terminal`.
5. Type `java -jar lotes.jar` and press `Enter`.<br>
   If your program is running correctly, you should see an output like this:
   ```
   Hello! I'm  #        ####  ##### ######  ####
               #       #    #   #   #      #
               #       #    #   #   #####   ####
               #       #    #   #   #           #

   What can I do for you?
   ```
