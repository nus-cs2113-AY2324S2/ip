## FAQ

1. If I exit the bot using anything other than `bye`, will I lose data?

No, data **might not** be lost. However, there is a chance of data corruption which may inevitably result in a full or partial loss of data depending on where it occurs.

2. How do I transfer data to other machines?

Copy the `ip.jar` file and `saveFile.txt` to the other machine. Place both of the files in the same directory, and Jarvas will be able to load the data file.
