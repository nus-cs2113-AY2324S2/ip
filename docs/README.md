# Casper User Guide
Casper is a chatbot-like desktop app for tracking and managing your tasks using the Command Line Interface (CLI). 

## Quick Start
1.  Ensure you have Java `11` installed.
2.  Install the latest `.jar` file [here](https://github.com/jensonjenkins/ip/releases/tag/A-Jar).
3.  Copy the file to a directory where you want to use Casper.
4. Open a command terminal, navigate to the directory where the `.jar` file is located.
5. Run `java -jar ip.jar` to run the application. You should be greeted with the following:

```dtd
    Starting
       ___ __ _ ___ _ __   ___ _ __
      / __/ _` / __| '_ \ / _ \ '__|
     | (_| (_| \__ \ |_) |  __/ |

                   | |              
                   |_|               
    _______________________________________________________________________
     Boo! I'm Casper!
     What can I do for you?
    _______________________________________________________________________

6. To execute a command, type in the command and press the Enter key. Typing an unrecognized command will prompt a list of valid keywords to try as such:
   
```dtd
