# Schmidt User Guide
Schmidt is a task manager CLI application that helps you to keep track of your tasks. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, and it is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Schmidt can help you manage your tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.
