***A:*** Install the app in the other computer and run it once. Simply overwrite the tasks.txt file that JunBot creates with your previous tasks.txt .

## Known issues
1. ***When setting dates in deadline and event***, users can place out of order dates, etc. ```event task /from 05/10/2024 /to 05/10/1999```
Should the unintended dates be inputted, the remedy is to delete the corresponding task, and create it again with the corrected dates.
