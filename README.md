# User Guide for chatbot "Apple"

Chatbot Apple is an app to manage tasks, optimised for use through a Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Quick Start
1. Ensure Java 11 or above is installed in your computer
2. Download `ip.jar` from [here](https://github.com/hongyijie06/ip/releases/tag/A-Jar)
3. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder with the jar file and use the `java -jar ip.jar` command to run the application.

A CLI similar to the picture below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app returns the path to which the list of tasks is saved on the local computer.
